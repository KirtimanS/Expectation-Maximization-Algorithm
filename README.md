# Expectation-Maximization-Algorithm
The EM algorithm is a weapon of choice to find parameters for Mixture of Gaussians. 
This was built to estimate the means for a MOG model given in the em.mat file. An additional method may be written to esitmate the variance of the model. 

The MOG model with missing paramters may be replaced with another model that you wish to choose.
